    <li>Clone the repository: <code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-3d-card</code></li>
    <li>Navigate to the project directory: <code>cd react-3d-card</code></li>
    <li>Install the dependencies: <code>npm install</code></li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Start the development server: <code>npm start</code></li>
    <li>Open your web browser and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> to see the 3D card in action.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Card</strong>: The main component that represents the 3D card. It handles the rotation and animation logic.</li>
    <li><strong>Trainers</strong>: A sub-component of the Card that renders the pair of trainers. This component can be customized to display different shoe models.</li>
    <li><strong>Controls</strong>: A sub-component of the Card that provides interactive controls for rotating the card.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Configuration</h2>
  <p>The configuration of the 3D card can be customized by modifying the following files:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>src/Card.js</code>: Modify this file to adjust the rotation behavior, animation settings, and other properties related to the card.</li>
    <li><code>src/Trainers.js</code>: Customize this file to change the appearance of the trainers. Replace the image assets with your desired shoe models.</li>
